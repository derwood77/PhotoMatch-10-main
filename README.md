Player can choose one to ten photos from their own iphone photoroll.  These are then duplicated and presented for matching in the game. The player is timed on matching all the pairs. If they get the fastest time, it is recorded.  Players can enter their own names - and the current one is preserved between games.  A warning is given if no player name has been chosen (when the game is newly installed).
